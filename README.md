- Due to the site being a static site (html & css), there are limitations to the scope of the website and its function can only be a descriptive site. Further investigaion, with expanded technologies, could expand the function of the website with more interaction with the user. 

# Testing
A process of continuous testing was carried out throughout the development of the website with display or functionality improvements made as they were warranted. Testing consisted of observing the site’s visible responses to different view screens and on different browsers.
The site was viewed and tested on the Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer and Safari browsers.

Google Chrome Developer tools and Firefox Developer edition were used to test site’s response to various screen sizes. Care was taken, during testing, to avoid overlapping of elements, loss of information due to scrolling off page and ensuring alignment of elements. 
Media queries are incorporated to ensure the site displays properly at break points between different device screen sizes. Over-lapping issues were detected on the navigation area when viewed on smaller screen size. The issue was resolved by introducing flex display in the navigation.

Internal links were tested to ensure that they navigated to the appropriate position on the site. External links were tested to ensure that a new page was opened whenever an external link was selected and that it was directed correctly.



# Validator Test
All Pages were run through the W3C HTML Validator and showed no errors.
CSS Stylesheet was run through the W3C CSS Validator and showed no errors.

# Resolutions to issues found during testing

- Spelling mistakes and ommissions were found when proof reading, were then corrected.
- Hero image zoomed in so that only a portion of the image could be seen. Issue resolved by sizing the image and saving the re-sized image.
- Navigation menu items were being overlapped on smaller screens. Resolved by adding a media query for small screens that changes display from row to column.
- Content was stretched across the entire width of the screen. Resolved by introducing container that had max width of 1100 px.
